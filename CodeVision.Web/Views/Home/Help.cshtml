<h1>How to search</h1>

<h2>Basics</h2>
Simply typing the word and clicking search button is often a good start. Surrond multiple words with double quotes, for example
<blockquote>"Licensed to the Apache Software Foundation"</blockquote>. Boolean operators <mark>AND</mark>, <mark>OR</mark>, <mark>NOT</mark> and parenthesis
are supported:

<blockquote>
    Licensed OR Software<br/>
    +Licensed Software
</blockquote>

Use <mark>*</mark>, <mark>?</mark> for wildcard searches, for example:

<blockquote>
    Licen*<br />
    sof?ware
</blockquote>


In these types of searches the content sources are treated as text and often produce quite a bit of hits.

<h2>Beyond Basics</h2>
Search expression consists of <em>field</em> and <em>term</em> separated by colon (<mark>:</mark>), for example <mark>content:lucene</mark>. If field is ommitted,
the default field of <mark>content</mark> is used. These are currently supported search fields:

<table class="table">
    <thead>
        <tr>
            <th>Field</th>
            <th>Purpose</th>
            <th>Example</th>
        </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
        <tr>
            <td><strong>class</strong></td>
            <td>Find files where this class is declared and defined</td>
            <td>class:Bindings</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td><strong>method</strong></td>
            <td>Where is this method defined?</td>
            <td>method:GetValueOrNull</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td><strong>parameter</strong></td>
            <td>Show me methods for the given parameter <strong>name</strong></td>
            <td>parameter:dictionary</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td><strong>return</strong></td>
            <td>Locate methods returning this <strong>type</strong></td>
            <td>return:double</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td><strong>base</strong></td>
            <td>Look for the classes derived from the given class</td>
            <td>base:doubledocvalues</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td><strong>code</strong></td>
            <td>Search within methods only. This can be helpful to ignore noice when too many hits are returned by general query.</td>
            <td>code:"prime*result"</td>
        </tr>

        <tr>
            <td><strong>comment</strong></td>
            <td>I need to see where the given search term used as multi-line or single-line comment</td>
            <td>comment:todo</td>
        </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>
